# E-Commerce Framework

## Why Pimcore E-Commerce Framework
The e-commerce environment has fundamentally changed and e-commerce projects often face new challenges like: 
 - **complex product structures:** lots of data attributes, complex product relations, configurable product systems, 
    different sources for products
 - **complex pricing structures:** product dependent price sources, tier pricing, pricing matrices, individual pricing 
   rules, integration of remote pricing services
 - **complex availability calculations**
 - **thousands customer groups with:** customer group specific prices, customer group specific assortments
 - **individual checkouts:** individual integration of backend systems, integration of multi-channel processes into 
   checkout workflow
 - **individual design**
 - **highly agile projects with changing requirements:** 'fail fast', fast changing environments and requirements
 - etc. 
 
We think for these challenges a default shop system that pops out of a box, that has a fixed product data model, fixed 
workflows, a template based frontend and needs to be connected and integrated with other systems via interfaces 
is not the tool to go for. 

We think for these challenges you need...
- a **framework for developers** to build **outstanding e-commerce solutions for customers**,
- with a native integration into Pimcore,
- with a component based architecture
- and a strict separation between backend functionality and frontend presentation. 

That is the idea behind the E-Commerce Framework of Pimcore. Like Pimcore itself, it is not a ready made system,
it is a set of tools and functionality to help building e-commerce applications really fast and flexible.
