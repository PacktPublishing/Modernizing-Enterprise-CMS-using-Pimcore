# Accessing Pimcore Assets via WebDAV

Pimcore provides the option to access all assets via [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV). To do so, 
just open following URL via your browser or WebDAV client: https://YOUR-DOMAIN/admin/asset/webdav

As user credentials use any Pimcore Backend user. Permissions for asset access are based on the users permissions.  

There is no additional server configuration necessary to get WebDAV up and running.
