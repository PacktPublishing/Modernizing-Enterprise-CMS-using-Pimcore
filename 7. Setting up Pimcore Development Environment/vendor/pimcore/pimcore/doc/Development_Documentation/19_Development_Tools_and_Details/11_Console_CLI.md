# CLI and Pimcore Console

Pimcore can be executed headless and has a very powerful PHP API. As a consequence of these two aspects, 
it is possible to automate pretty much every task within Pimcore. 

Pimcore implements the `Symfony\Console` component and provides `bin/console` as single 
entry point to console commands registered to the `Symfony\Console` application. 


### Implementing own Commands
Have a look at the `Symfony\Console` [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/5.2/console.html) 
for details how commands are implemented. However, it makes sense to let your command classes extend 
`Pimcore\Console\AbstractCommand` to get some defaults like the `--ignore-maintenance-mode` option 
and a helper for the [Symfony VarDumper Component](https://symfony.com/doc/5.2/components/var_dumper/index.html) 
set up automatically (see below).

### Registering Commands
Command must be registered as services and tagged with the `console.command` tag. If you're using the default `services.yml` of Pimcore skeleton (or demos) for  configuration, this is already done for you for the `App`. , thanks to autoconfiguration.

### Helpers provided by `Pimcore\Console\AbstractCommand`
The `AbstractCommand` base class provides helpers which make your life easier.

##### `--ignore-maintenance-mode`
The console application implicitly adds the `--ignore-maintenance-mode` option found in other scripts.
`AbstractConsoleCommand` checks for the option and aborts the command if the system is in maintenance 
mode and the option is not set.

##### `dump()` and `dumpVerbose()`
Better `var_dump` through [`VarDumper`](https://symfony.com/doc/5.2/components/var_dumper/introduction.html). 

## Example
```php
<?php

namespace App\Command;

use Pimcore\Console\AbstractCommand;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;

class AwesomeCommand extends AbstractCommand
{
    protected function configure()
    {
        $this
            ->setName('awesome:command')
            ->setDescription('Awesome command');
    }

    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)
    {
        // dump
        $this->dump("Isn't that awesome?");

        // add newlines through flags
        $this->dump("Dump #2");

        // only dump in verbose mode
        $this->dumpVerbose("Dump verbose");
        
        // Output as white text on red background.
        $this->writeError('oh noes!');

        // Output as green text.
        $this->writeInfo('info');

        // Output as blue text.
        $this->writeComment('comment');

        // Output as yellow text.
        $this->writeQuestion('question');
    }
}
```

### Usage
Call `bin/console list` script from the command line to get a list of available commands. To call 
a command, use `bin/console <subcommand>`.

> Be sure to run the console with the PHP user to prevent writing permissions issues later, either by calling `php bin/console` or by switching to the appropriate user, for instance on Debian system `su -l www-data -s /bin/bash`.

##### Examples:
```php
# get a list of all registered commands
$ ./bin/console list
 
# call the foo:bar command
$ ./bin/console foo:bar
```
