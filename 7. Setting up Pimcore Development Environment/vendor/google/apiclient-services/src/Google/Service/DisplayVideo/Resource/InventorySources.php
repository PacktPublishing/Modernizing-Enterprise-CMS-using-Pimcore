   * Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more
   * restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical
   * operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction
   * has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The operator must be `EQUALS
   * (=)`. * Supported fields: - `status.entityStatus` - `commitment` -
   * `deliveryMethod` - `rateDetails.rateType` - `exchange` Examples: * All active
   * inventory sources: `status.entityStatus="ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE"` * Inventory
   * sources belonging to Google Ad Manager or Rubicon exchanges:
   * `exchange="EXCHANGE_GOOGLE_AD_MANAGER" OR exchange="EXCHANGE_RUBICON"` The
   * length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
   * @opt_param string orderBy Field by which to sort the list. Acceptable values
   * are: * `displayName` (default) The default sorting order is ascending. To
   * specify descending order for a field, a suffix "desc" should be added to the
   * field name. For example, `displayName desc`.
   * @opt_param int pageSize Requested page size. Must be between `1` and `100`.
   * If unspecified will default to `100`.
   * @opt_param string pageToken A token identifying a page of results the server
   * should return. Typically, this is the value of next_page_token returned from
   * the previous call to `ListInventorySources` method. If not specified, the
   * first page of results will be returned.
   * @opt_param string partnerId The ID of the partner that has access to the
   * inventory source.
