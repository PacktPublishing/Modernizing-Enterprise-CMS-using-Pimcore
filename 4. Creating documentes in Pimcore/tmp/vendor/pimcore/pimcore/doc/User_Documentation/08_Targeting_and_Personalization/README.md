# Behavioral Targeting and Personalization 

Pimcore provides a very powerful integrated behavioral targeting and personalization engine. With this toolkit it is 
possible to profile visitors based on their behavior, assign target groups to them and provide personalized content to 
these target groups. This makes it possible to show contextual, relevant, and personalized content to your customers.

Before starting with Personalization you should know about following Pimcore concepts: 

* [Target Group](./01_Concepts.md)
* [Global Targeting Rule](./01_Concepts.md)
* [Personalized Document Content](./01_Concepts.md)


After reading everything about the base concepts, you are 
[ready to get started with personalizing content](./03_How_to_Personalize_Content/README.md).
