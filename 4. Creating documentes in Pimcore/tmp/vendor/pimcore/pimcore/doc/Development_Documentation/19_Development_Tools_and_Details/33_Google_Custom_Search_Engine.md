# Google Custom Search Engine (Site Search ~ CSE) Integration

## Introduction
Pimcore provides a simple interface to the Google Custom Search Engine which 
makes it easy to integrate a search engine into your website. 

[Further information about Google CSE](http://www.google.com/cse/)

## Setup in CSE Control Panel and Google Cloud Console
* Create and configure a new search engine at [http://www.google.com/cse/](http://www.google.com/cse/) - 
for more information please visit: [http://support.google.com/customsearch/](http://support.google.com/customsearch/) .
* Test your search engine first using the preview on the right hand side. 
* If your results are as expected, go back to "Setup" (-> left navigation) and note the search engine ID 
- You'll need it later in the code (parameter 'cx'  in configuration):

* Once you are finished go to [https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/) 
create a new project, then search for `Custom Search API` and click on `Enable`.
`Custom Search API` should now be listed under `Enabled APIs` in your project overview.
* To get the necessary access keys, click on: `Credentials` -> `Create credentials` -> `API key` -> `Server key`
Complete the setup as described and note the server API key.

## Pimcore Setup
So now we got the search engine ID and a server API key which we need to finish the 
configuration in Pimcore. 

### Server API Key
Open the system settings in Pimcore and paste the API key into the marked field below and 
save.

### Search engine ID
The search engine ID is used in your controller/action to configure the search service: 
`\Pimcore\Google\Cse::search()`.

The place of interest (parameter cx) is marked with a comment in the code example below.
