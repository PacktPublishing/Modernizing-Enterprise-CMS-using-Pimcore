# Product Index Configuration

The configuration of the *Product Index* defines the content of the *Product Index* (which attributes are extracted how
and stored where) and takes place in the `pimcore_ecommerce_framework` configuration within the section `index_service`.
The product index can define multiple tenants (see [Assortment Tenant Configuration](./03_Assortment_Tenant_Configuration.md))
which can be configured individually. Each tenant defines a set of attributes to index/search and a configuration and worker
class responsible for storing and managing the index. 


```yaml

    index_service:
        # product index defines multiple tenants which can be disabled individually

                # is only able to accept a certain config implementation (e.g. an elasticsearch worker can only operate
                # on an elasticsearch config). as long as you don't implement a custom worker you can omit the wotker_id
                # as the system is able to automatically resolve the worker for a given config

                # in this example, the "default" tenant will have the attributes name

                #
                # please make sure to use double %% or another char as {} to denote placeholders

```

### `search_attributes`

Defines attributes which should be considered in fulltext-search. All attributes must be defined within the 
`attributes`-section. 

### `attributes`

Defines for all attributes if and how they should be indexed. Each attribute is referenced with an unique name (e.g. `seoname`
or `rucksacksLoad` in the example above) which is the name of the attribute in the product index. The following configuration
options are available: 
 
- `type` (mandatory for mysql): Datatype for column in Product Index. 
- `field_name` (optional): Field name in product object, needed if it is different than `name` in index. Defaults to `name`
- `locale` (optional): Used locale for data retrieving if field is in a localized field. 
- `getter_id` (optional): Service ID of a special getter implementation for getting attribute value. Per default, the
   method `get<NAME>()` of the product object is called. If this is not suitable, an alternative getter class can be defined
   which is responsible for getting the value. This can be used for calculations, getting complex values (field collections,
   object bricks), etc. Getter implementations need to implement `\Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Getter\GetterInterface`
   interface and be defined as service. Best practice is to use the fully qualified class name as service ID and to reference
   the class name in the configuration.
- `getter_options` (optional): options passed to the getter when resolving a value. Available options vary by getter implementation.
- `interpreter_id` (optional): By default all data is stored without any transformation in the Product Index. With an 
   interpreter, this data can be transformed and manipulated before storing. This can be used for only saving IDs 
   of assets, normalization of data, special treatment of relations, etc. Interpreter implementations need to implement
   `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\InterpreterInterface` interface. The same service ID best practices
   as for getters apply to interpreters.
- `interpreter_options` (optional): options passed to the interpreter. Available options vary by interpreter implementation.
- `hide_in_fieldlist_datatype` (optional): Hides column in FieldList drop down (see [FilterService](../../07_Filter_Service/README.md) 
   for more information).
- `filter_group` (optional): Defines filter group for the FieldList drop down (see [FilterService](../../07_Filter_Service/README.md) 
   for more information).

#### Relations in *Product Index*
Relations are stored in a special way in *Product Index* and also need to be filtered in a different way in the 
[Product List](../07_Product_List.md).
 
In order to store relations correctly in the Product Index, relation attributes must have an interpreter defined which 
implements the interface `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\RelationInterpreterInterface`. 


#### Selection of available Getters:
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Getter\DefaultBrickGetter`: Gets data from an Object Brick. 
  Needed configuration: 
  - `brickfield`: Field name of Object Brick, e.g. `bricks`. 
  - `bricktype`: Type of Object Brick, e.g. `TentBrick`. 
  - `fieldname`: Field name of attribute in Object Brick, e.g. `height`. 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Getter\DefaultBrickGetterSequence`: Same as `DefaultBrickGetter`, 
   but can use more than one source definition and stores first found value in *Product Index*. 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Getter\DefaultBrickGetterSequenceToMultiselect`: Like 
  `DefaultBrickGetterSequence`, but stores all found values as a multi select in the *Product Index*. 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Getter\TagsGetter`: Gets [Tags](../../../18_Tools_and_Features/09_Tags.md) 
  of product object and returns them as array. 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Getter\DefaultClassificationAttributeGetter`: Gets attribute value
  from classification store. Possible options: 
   - `key_id` - id of the classification store attribute
   - `group_id` - id of the group related to the id | key can occur multiple times in classification store field through multiple groups
   - `fieldname` - name of the field upon which the classification store is saved on the specific object (defaults to attributes)

#### Selection of available Interpreters:
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\AssetId`: Stores only asset id into *Product Index*.
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\DefaultObjects`: Default interpreter to store object 
  relations as relations into the *Product Index*.
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\DefaultRelations`: Same as `DefaultObjects` but also 
  for other relations to Assets and Documents. Also can deal with `ObjectMetadata`. 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\DefaultStructuredTable`: Interpreter for structured
  table data type. Expects following configuration options: 
     - `row`
     - `column`
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\IdList`: Returns id list of given values as CSV list. 
 If configuration option `multiSelectEncoded` is set, it returns id list encoded as multi select (relevant for filtering 
 in Product List). 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\Numeric`: Returns `floatval` of given value. 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\QuantityValue`: Interprets quantity value data types, 
  by default by serializing it to string, when config option `onlyValue` set to `true`, it returns only value 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\ObjectId`: Returns id of given object. 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\ObjectIdSum`: Calculates sum if ids of given objects. 
Could be used for similarity calculation. 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\ObjectValue`: Get value from an related object. 
Expects following configuration options: 
     - `['target']['fieldname']`: Field name of value to get. Is used for getter generation which is called on given object. 
     - `['target']['locale']`: Locale is optionally passed as first parameter to getter. 
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\Round`: Rounds given value to integer.
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\Soundex`: Returns soundex of given value. Could be used 
for similarity calculation.
- `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\IndexService\Interpreter\DefaultClassificationStore`: Stores all classification
  store attributes of a data object to the index. Only usable in combination with elastic search. 
  See [Filter Classification Store](../../07_Filter_Service/03_Elastic_Search/01_Filter_Classification_Store.md) 
  for details. 

> Depending on the *Product Index* implementation, the *Product Index* configuration can be slightly different.
