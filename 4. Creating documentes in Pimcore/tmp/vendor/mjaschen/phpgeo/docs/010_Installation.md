Older PHP versions are supported in releases up to _phpgeo_ 1.3.8.

_phpgeo_ is best be installed using Composer. Please visit the
[Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/) website for more information.

To install _phpgeo,_ simply “require” it using Composer:

``` shell

```

## Installation of Development Tools

Most of the development dependencies are managed with [Phive](https://phar.io/).

For that you have to install Phive first. Now a simple `phive install` fetches all required Phar archives and installs them into the `tools` directory.
