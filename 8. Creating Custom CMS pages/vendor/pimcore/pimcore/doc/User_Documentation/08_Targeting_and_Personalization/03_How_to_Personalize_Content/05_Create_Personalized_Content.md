# Create Personalized Content

The simplest way to create personalized content is with Pimcore documents. They provide the possibility to create 
varying content variants for each defined target group.

Once a target group is selected, all content elements within the document can be overwritten and personalized. To 
overwrite a certain element, use context menu of the element and select overwrite.

All not overwritten content elements are greyed and inherit the content from the default variant of the document.
