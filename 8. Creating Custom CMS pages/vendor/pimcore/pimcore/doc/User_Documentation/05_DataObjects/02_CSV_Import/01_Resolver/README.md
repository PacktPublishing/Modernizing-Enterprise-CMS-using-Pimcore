# Resolver Strategies

> This is an experimental feature and subject to change without notice.

A resolver strategy allows you to define how an existing object is matched based on the CSV data or how a new one gets created.

> You can choose a specific object type (object or variant) via a dropdown menu or decide to keep the existing setting. Moreover, the 'dynamic' option allows you to specify a CSV object type column.
