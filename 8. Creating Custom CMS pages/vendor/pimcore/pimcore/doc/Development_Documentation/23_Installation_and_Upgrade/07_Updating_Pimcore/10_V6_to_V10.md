# Upgrading Pimcore from Version 6.9 to Version 10

# Flush your `/tmp` directories
```bash
rm -r var/tmp
rm -r web/var/tmp
```

# Flush your recycle-bin
Migrating the items in the recycle-bin is not supported.
To have a clear start with Pimcore 10 we recommend to flush it before migration.
```bash
rm -r var/recyclebin
```

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE recyclebin;
```

# Move user images
The default location of the user images has changed, simply move the contents over to the new location: 
```bash
mkdir var/admin
mv var/user-images var/admin/user-images
```

# Update your `.htaccess` or your Nginx configuration
- Updated `.htaccess` is available [here](https://github.com/pimcore/skeleton/blob/master/public/.htaccess). 
- Updated Nginx configuration is available [here](../03_System_Setup_and_Hosting/02_Nginx_Configuration.md).
