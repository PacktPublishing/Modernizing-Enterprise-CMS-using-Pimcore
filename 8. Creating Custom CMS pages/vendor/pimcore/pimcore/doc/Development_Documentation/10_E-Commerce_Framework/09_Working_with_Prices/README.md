# Working with Prices

Prices are an essential part of every E-Commerce solution. In order to be able to implement complex and very custom
pricing schemes, the E-Commerce Framework has the concept of [Pricing Systems](./01_Price_Systems_and_getting_Prices.md). 
These Pricing Systems encapsulate all the logic of retrieving and calculating prices. 
 
The [Tax Management Component](./03_Tax_Management.md) adds functionality for dealing with taxes and should be flexible
enough to implement all kinds of tax structures. 

With [Pricing Rules](./05_Pricing_Rules.md) and [Vouchers](./07_Vouchers.md) marketing actions can be implemented.

For details on how to calculate with prices, see [Calculate with Prices](./09_Calculate_with_Prices.md).
