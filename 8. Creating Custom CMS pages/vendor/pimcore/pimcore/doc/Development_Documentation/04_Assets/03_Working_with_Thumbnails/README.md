# Working with Thumbnails

Pimcore provides a sophisticated thumbnail processing engine for calculating thumbnails based on source assets. So for 
different output channels Pimcore can calculate and provide optimized images in terms of dimensions, file sizes, formats
and much more.

This functionality allows true single source publishing with Pimcore. 

##### Thumbnails are available for following file types: 
* [Image Thumbnails](./01_Image_Thumbnails.md)
* [Video Thumbnails](./03_Video_Thumbnails.md)
* [Asset Document Thumbnails](./05_Document_Thumbnails.md)


##### For more information about configuring thumbnails in Pimcore backend have a look at [User Documentation]().
