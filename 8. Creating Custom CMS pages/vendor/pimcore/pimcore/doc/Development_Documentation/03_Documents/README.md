# Documents
Documents are the CMS part of Pimcore and are the way to go for managing unstructured contents using pages, content snippets and navigations. 

## Document Types
Pimcore offers different types of documents and each of them offers functionality specific for the intended use-case. 

| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                 | 
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Page           | Represents a typical web-page, the path in the tree is equal to the address in the browser.                                                                 |
| Snippet        | Makes it easier to extract often used contents into reusable containers. Can be embedded in pages or nested into other snippets.                            |
| Link           | A simple web-link to be used in navigation.                                                                                                                |
| Email          | A document like the page, but with special functionality for transactional emails.                                                                        |
| [Newsletter](./02_Document_Types/05_Newsletter_Documents.md)     | Like email, but offering additional newsletter functionality.                                                                                             |
| Hardlink       | Create links to other document structures and reuse them within a different structure / context. (see [Hard link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link)) |
| Folder         | Just like the folders you know from your local filesystem.                                                                                                  | 
| [PrintPage](./02_Document_Types/15_Print_Documents.md)      | Like pages, but specialized for print (PDF preview, rendering options, ...)                                                                                 | 
| [PrintContainer](./02_Document_Types/15_Print_Documents.md) | Organizing print pages in chapters and render them all together.                                                                                            | 


## Document Configuration

Many documents types are tight to the [MVC](../02_MVC/README.md) and therefore they need a underlying controller/action and a template. 
They are directly specified in the document settings in the admin interface: 

![Documents: controller and view settings](../img/documents_controller_and_view_settings.png)

Not all of them are necessary, the table below shows which configurations are possible:

| Type | Controller | Action | Template | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|------|------------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | X          | X      |          | The specified controller/action is executed. If the action returns a response object, it is used for rendering. If no response is returned, the controller implements TemplateControllerInterface and `$this->setViewAutoRender($event->getRequest(), true, 'php');` is called, the template is auto-discovered based on controller and action name like `<BUNDLENAME>:<CONTROLLERNAME>:<ACTIONNAME>.html.php` .|
| 2    | X          | X      | X        | Same as above but the template specified is rendered and not the auto-discovered template (only if action does not return a response). |
| 3    |            |        | X        | Renders the template with the default controller/action, this is practical if there is only templating stuff. |

Optionally you can specify a module to each of the above combinations, this is useful if you want to use controllers/actions or templates out of plugins which are simply another Symfony bundle. 
The default module (when empty) is AppBundle.

Pimcore is shipped with a default controller containing a default action, which is called when only a template is given to the document.

You can set a default module/bundle, controller and action in the symfony configuration:

```yaml
pimcore:
    routing:
        defaults:
            bundle: AppBundle
            controller: Default
            action: default 
```  

## Properties

[Properties](../18_Tools_and_Features/07_Properties.md) are very powerful in combination with documents.
Below, you can find some examples where properties can be very useful for the use with documents. 

1. **Navigation** - If you build the navigation based on the document-tree, sometimes you need special settings for the frontend, like separators or highlightings.
2. **Header Images** - Often there are header images on a website, if you don't want to define it for every page, you can use properties with inheritance. Then you can define a default one at the root document, and overrule this on a deeper level in the tree structure.
3. **Sidebars** - You can easily manage visibility of sidebars in specific documents.
4. **SEO** - It's also possible to use properties for SEO. It's very painful to define a nice title and description for every page on your site, with properties this is not necessary (inheritance).
5. **Protected Areas** - Closed user groups
6. Change the appearance of the website depending on the properties (eg. micro-sites, nested sites)
7. Mark them for some automated exports (PDF, RPC's, â€¦)

As you can see there are really useful cases for properties, feel free to use them for whatever they seem to be useful.

## A Few Facts

* Documents follow the MVC pattern; therefore, Pimcore requires that there is at least one controller with an action and a template file.
* Pimcore comes with a DefaultController containing a defaultAction and a template file.
* Because of the MVC architecture, there is a clear separation between your data, the functionality and the templates.
* The normal way to create templates for Pimcore is to use pure PHP. There's no new template syntax to learn - just code what you want - feel free!
* Although the templates are written in PHP, there is a clear separation as mentioned before.
