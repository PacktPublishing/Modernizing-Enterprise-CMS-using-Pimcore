   * @opt_param string filter Allows filtering by Google audience fields.
   * Supported syntax: * Filter expressions for Google audiences currently can

   * `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The operator must be `CONTAINS (:)`. *
   * Supported fields: - `displayName` Examples: * All Google audiences for which
   * the display name contains "Google": `displayName : "Google"`. The length of
   * this field should be no more than 500 characters.
   * @opt_param string orderBy Field by which to sort the list. Acceptable values
   * are: * `googleAudienceId` (default) * `displayName` The default sorting order
   * is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix "desc" should
   * be added to the field name. Example: `displayName desc`.
   * @opt_param int pageSize Requested page size. Must be between `1` and `100`.
   * If unspecified will default to `100`. Returns error code `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
   * if an invalid value is specified.
   * @opt_param string pageToken A token identifying a page of results the server
   * should return. Typically, this is the value of next_page_token returned from
   * the previous call to `ListGoogleAudiences` method. If not specified, the
   * first page of results will be returned.
   * @opt_param string partnerId The ID of the partner that has access to the
   * fetched Google audiences.
